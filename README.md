Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to look at differences between two different months tempurature data for the purposes of seeing if a surf and ice cream shop business model is sustainable

Results

1. The average data for June and December is within 3 degrees of each other, and given these months being in opposite seasons it is reasonable to assume that most every month in this area is relatively consistent in tempurature year round.

2. The max tempuratures are also very similar, and are high enough that if the tempurature stays mostly between the average and the max those fall well within comfortable tempuratures where one might want to both surf and have ice cream.

3. The min tempuratues for June are also bearable enough for both surfing and ice cream, and while December dips in its minimums that surfing might be out of the question, this is a small enough part of the year that given other data it can be assumed that most of the time people will still want ice cream and to surf.

Summary

The tempuratures drawn from the data show that it is reasonable to assume that the proposed business model of the surf and ice cream shop would be succesful. The max and average temps are high enough that consumers would most likely be drawn to surf and have ice cream year round, and the mins while low are high enough that one would assume it wouldn't shut down the business.
